						<h1>Solution</h1>
						<p class="info">Research and interviews were compiled into primary calls to action and a style tile for the new website developement.</p>
					</header>
					<h2>Calls to Action</h2>
					<span class="image fit"><img src="images/CTA.pdf" alt=""></span>
					<p>There are two main objectives of the site: spreading awareness through education and aiding those in need through monetary donations.
						KNOW MORE addresses the first objective; some will come to the site out of curiosity or word of mouth without any knowledge of Romanian history or the needs in general.
						We want people to educated first, to know more about these things so that they can help spread awareness. HELP NOW addresses the second objective.
						There will be several ways to help now including family or child sponsorships, hosting pop-ups, and clothing drives. While monetary donation will probably be the largest of these,
						there are more ways to help, so help now fits better than donate now.</p>
					<h2>Style Tile</h2>
					 <p class="info">The style tile is meant to be an example or preview of the planned site using possible colors, textures, fonts, and other elements.</p>
					<span class="image fit"><img src="images/StyleTileFinalSite.pdf" alt=""></span>
						<p>The goal was to present the Releif Fund for Romania as an informative, compassionate, organized and trustworthy non-profit.
							These adjectives were chosen based on the immediate needs of the website and how potential users described an organization they would want to partner with.
						 	I chose the typefaces Georgia and Acumin Variable Concept because I felt that they reflected the desired adjectives.</p>
						<p>The colors chosen are less saturated versions of the colors on the Romanian flag, paired with an off white and a deep grey. The blue in this case acts as the contrasting color
							which both nods to the colors of the original site, and is less harsh than a red or yellow. There are two CTAs and the primary is solid blue while the secondary is blue text on a white background.
							The home image is meant to cycle or change, so these contasting buttons should stand out againts a variety of backgrounds.</p>
						<p>The textures, or sample images, were chosen for a few reasons. First, they all have a similar color tone; while not the same, there is not one image that seems too dull or bright compared to the others.
							These images are also real. While there is sadness and poor living conditions, there are also happy children and warm villages. My goal was to show possible photos that could all realte aesthetically,
							and also display the real people and places the organization is trying to help.</p>
