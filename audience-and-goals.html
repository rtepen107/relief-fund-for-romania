						<h1>Audience and Goals</h1>
						<p class="info">After conducting the preliminary research, the target audience and the goals best suited to meet the needs of such groups defined.</p>
					</header>
					<h2>Audience</h2>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Audience1.jpeg"></p>
						<p>Pinpointing the audience and goals required starting broad and narrowing down to the specifics.</p>
						<p>The first step was to list the target groups in need and then list those the site would draw in in order to help. The audience members would most likely be donors of some kind or an orginization looking to partner with us. The Donors would be the most desirable audience followed by those spreading the word by way of social media.</p>
						<p>Orphans, orphanages and donors were paired together as the most need because those were the two grouos that need the most aid and would give the most aid, respectively.
						 	The next focus group would be the disabled and social media because these areas did not have much focus. Later, I realised that impoverished families would be more of a secondary focus than the disabled minority.</p>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
					<h2>Goals</h2>
					<p class="info">Once the audience and target groups were defined, each group, including the website, were given major goals.
						These overarching goals were then broken down into more specific groups with desired actions and required content.</p>

					<h4>Goals Conclusion</h4>
						<p>The Relief Fund for Romania seeks to direct and provide aid to those in need in Romania.
							This exercise helped narrow down the groups that the organization should focus on, and in what priority.
							It became apparent that there was a large need for a social media presence, in order to both educate and also give updates for events or projects.
							These goals were done before any interviews, so the priority of certain groups and actions would shift slightly, but most stayed the same.</p>
						<p>The new site would need clear and concise information placed appropriatly first. There would need to be updated or new pages such as sponsorships, a more organized donation page and a Pop-Ups page.
							The key would generally have to be how information was delivered both in form and tone. The placement of these elements in order to attract the attention of the right audience would also need to be sorted.</p>
